# UTILITY OF EXOME SEQUENCING IN INDIAN CHILDREN WITH RENAL TUBULAR DISORDERS


### Hypothesis/Research question
- To determine the diagnostic yield of Exome Sequencing (ES) and its utility in confirming diagnosis in clinical setting <br>

### Findings

- ES used in diagnostic workflow helps to confirm molecular diagnosis (54%).  <br>  

- ES revising clinical diagnosis or establish etiology in previously undiagnosed tubular diseases (8 %).  <br>  


### Samples
Total Number of Patients Screened: **225** <br>  
Total Number of Patients Samples sequenced: **135** <br>  
 
### Data
    
- Patients and Clinical data: <br>
Children with clinically diagnosis or suspected to have renal tubulopathy (children < 18 years of age). Clinical data, laboratory and pedigree information. <br>   

### Study methodology

- Kit: Agilent SureSelect <br>  
- Platform: Illumina Hiseq (150 bps, PE, mean coverage 80 â€“ 100X) <br>

### Results

- Diagnostic yield of genomic testing in various diagnostic  categories of renal tubular disorders in children <br>

- Summary of distribution of causative variants on the basis of individual genes associated with renal tubular disorders  <br>

Each row represents a gene and each column a patient along with the type of variant (colored squares), family history (FH) & consanguinity (HC) and age at diagnosis (lower graph)  <br>  
- Variants detected by ES following in-house tertiary analysis pipeline <br>

ES reclassified diagnosis in 7/73 (9.5%) cases and ES helped established diagnosis in 4/73 (5.4%) cases with unknown tubular disorder  <br>
